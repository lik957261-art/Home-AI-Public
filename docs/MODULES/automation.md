# Module: Automation And Cron

## Responsibility

Automation owns scheduled jobs, detail loading, Web Push/deep-link production, and product-layer cron dispatch isolation. User-facing delivery reading is moving to Action Inbox; Automation remains the background job engine and admin/troubleshooting surface.

## Core Files

- `server-routes/automation-api-routes.js`
- `public/app-automation-controller-ui.js`
- `public/app-automation-ui.js`
- `cron_bridge.py`
- `scripts/hermes-mobile-cron-dispatcher.py`
- `scripts/run-cron-tick-sidecar.ps1`
- `scripts/start-cron-tick-sidecar.ps1`

## Product Rules

- Foreground Automation list should preserve the full-detail display format.
- Product direction: Automation should not remain a permanent primary bottom tab after Action Inbox is active.
- Completed user-visible deliveries and failed runs should upsert Action Inbox items so the user reads/acts from Inbox.
- Summary/detail optimizations must not visually downgrade the user-facing list.
- Full-cache reads are only a first paint: the background full refresh must update the visible list when newer status or ordering arrives.
- The list should sort by latest activity, defined as the latest of last run time or latest deliverable time, so failed runs without new files still surface promptly.
- Status badges should reflect the latest run result. A scheduled job whose latest run failed must show a failure state until a later successful run clears it.
- Web Push notifications should open the specific automation detail when `automationId` is present.
- After Action Inbox integration, Automation Web Push payloads should include `inboxItemId` when the user's next action is represented by Inbox.
- Foreground Web Push with `messageType=automation_*` or `automationId` must invalidate Automation full-cache state. If the Automation view is open, it should force a full refresh and repaint the list after fresh data arrives.
- Long cron jobs must not block the scheduling entrance.

## Cron Dispatcher

Hermes Mobile uses `scripts/hermes-mobile-cron-dispatcher.py` as a product-layer wrapper. It dispatches due jobs into detached runners and returns quickly.

Detached cron runners may execute from the interactive Ubuntu distro while the dedicated Grok Gateway listens behind the Windows host / worker-distro loopback boundary. For `x_search`, the dispatcher should pass `HERMES_MOBILE_X_SEARCH_PROXY_URL` pointing at the bridge-host route `/bridge/grok-gateway-proxy`; runners should not assume `127.0.0.1:<grok-port>` reaches the Grok worker.

Do not patch official Hermes runtime cron source for this behavior unless explicitly approved.

## Validation

- `node tests\automation-api-routes.test.js`
- `node tests\cron-bridge.test.js`
- `node tests\startup-scripts.test.js`
- `node tests\task-list-ui.test.js`
- `python -m py_compile cron_bridge.py scripts\hermes-mobile-cron-dispatcher.py`

## Constraints

- Static-only Automation UI changes do not require listener restart.
- Route or bridge changes require listener restart.
- Gateway Pool restart is only needed for Gateway worker/profile/plugin/schema changes.
